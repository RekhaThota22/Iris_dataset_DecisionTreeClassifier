# Iris_dataset_DecisionTreeClassifier
Used DecisionTreeClassifier on Iris_dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning, particularly for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. For each sample, four features are measured:
Sepal length (in cm)
Sepal width (in cm)
Petal length (in cm)
Petal width (in cm)
The goal of a decision tree classifier on this dataset is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these four features.
